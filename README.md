## Installation

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/springwell/cli.git
cd cli

# Build the CLI
go build -o springwell cmd/springwell/main.go

# Make it executable
chmod +x springwell

# Optional: Move to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv springwell /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Go Install
```bash
go install github.com/springwell/cli/cmd/springwell@latest
```

### Using Install Script
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.springwell.dev | bash
```

## Usage

SpringWell CLI has two modes of operation: command-line mode and interactive mode.

### Command-Line Mode

```bash
# Create a new Spring Boot project
springwell new my-project

# Create a project with a specific template
springwell new my-project --template aws-temporal-auth0

# Run application in development mode
springwell dev

# Run with custom port and profile
springwell dev --port 8081 --profile local

# Build the application
springwell build

# Run tests
springwell test

# Run a specific test
springwell test --test UserServiceTest

# Check project health
springwell doctor

# Generate components
springwell generate entity User name:String email:String:nullable

# Generate a controller
springwell generate controller User

# Generate a service
springwell generate service User

# Get help with any command
springwell help generate
```

### Interactive Mode

SpringWell CLI offers an interactive mode that guides you through various operations with a menu-based interface. This is especially useful for new users or when exploring features.

```bash
# Start the CLI in interactive mode
springwell interactive
# or use the shorthand
springwell i
```

In interactive mode, you can:

1. Generate a brand new project with guided prompts
2. Generate various components (entities, controllers, services, etc.)
3. Run your application in development mode
4. Build your project
5. Run tests
6. Check project health

The interactive mode will walk you through each operation step by step, prompting for required information.

### Common Options

All commands support the following options:

- `--quiet` or `-q`: Suppress non-error output
- `--json`: Output in JSON format (for scripting)
- `--help`: Show help information
- `--version`: Show version information

## Examples

### Creating a New Project with AWS, Temporal, and Auth0 Integration

```bash
springwell new my-aws-app --template aws-temporal-auth0 --db postgres
```

### Generating Complete API Endpoints

```bash
# Generate an entity
springwell generate entity Product name:String price:Double description:String:nullable

# Generate a repository
springwell generate repository Product

# Generate a service
springwell generate service Product

# Generate a controller
springwell generate controller Product
```

### Generating Temporal Workflows

```bash
# Generate a Temporal workflow + activity
springwell generate workflow OrderProcessing
```

## Configuration

SpringWell CLI uses a `.springwell.yml` file in your project root to store configuration. This file is automatically created when you create a new project.

Example configuration:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  package: com.example.myproject
  template: aws-temporal-auth0
  database: postgres
```

## Templates

SpringWell CLI comes with pre-defined templates:

- `basic`: Standard Spring Boot project
- `aws-temporal-auth0`: AWS-optimized Spring Boot with Temporal workflows and Auth0 authentication
